                        <h3>RULES OF PLAY & POLICIE<h3>
                </div>
        <P id="espacio">FIFA rules shall govern NYSL play except as modified herein</P>
        <h3>SPORTSMANSHIP</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire youth to
                practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, team,
                parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from this
                purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical soccer
                background, expertise, accomplishments or standing. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>FIELD REGULATIONS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>DIMENSIONS.</strong> FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
                within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should
                be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>COMPETITION FIELDS.</strong> Fields used within the competition program must be a
                minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating
                in the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that
                meets these minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board
                which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend
                to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should
                be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations that are unable
                to provide an acceptable field may be required to play all their games away.
            </li>
            <li><strong>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS</strong></li>
            <div>
                <ul class="listaUl">
                    <li>U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty areas.
                        Fields for older age groups should be progressively larger.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.
                    </li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal
                        dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

        </ol>

        <h3>ALL-PLAY</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All-play means that every recreation player on every team shall play atleast
                fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the competition program are encouraged
                to play their players 50% of each game.
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>A Coach shall be permitted to not play a player 50% of each game under
                    special circumstances, e.g., unexcused absences from practice and/or
                    games, ungentlemanly conduct at practice and/or games, and injuries.
                </li>
